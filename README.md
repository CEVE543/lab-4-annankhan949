# Lab 4: Bayesian Rainfall Analysis

**Date:** September 19, 2025 | **Module:** 1 | **Week:** 4

## Overview

This lab introduces Bayesian modeling for extreme value analysis through an iterative workflow emphasizing thoughtful prior specification. Students will develop Bayesian GEV models using Turing.jl and ArviZ.jl, learning to think like Bayesian statisticians while building tools for Houston rainfall analysis.

## Topics Covered

- Iterative prior specification and prior predictive checking
- Bayesian GEV modeling with Turing.jl and MCMC sampling
- ArviZ.jl for modern Bayesian diagnostics and visualization
- Two-station comparative analysis with uncertainty quantification
- Return level estimation with full Bayesian uncertainty propagation
- Efficient caching strategies for computational workflows

## Objectives

- Set up Bayesian GEV models with informative priors
- Develop strategies for prior specification in extreme value analysis
- Compare rainfall patterns between two stations using Bayesian inference

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab builds the complete Bayesian GEV toolkit that students will use for PS1 Tasks 1 and 3, providing essential skills in prior specification, convergence diagnostics, and uncertainty quantification for extreme value analysis.
